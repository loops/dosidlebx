Original DosIdle
----------------

Obtained from https://github.com/galazwoj/dosidle.git
Copied the documentation text file and the full and partial source.
They've been converted to utf-8 to make them easier to work with
on a modern machine.


Modified DosIdle
----------------

My application needs to run a slightly modified DosIdle (v2.51).
The original DosIdle considers checking the date or time as
the application not being idle.  But my app runs both of those
operations a lot, when it is in fact otherwise idle.  So my
modification here, ignores those two DOS calls, and no longer
considers them as indicative of being busy.


Assemble
--------

Tasm 4.0 assembler in the archive here, from https://github.com/zajo/TASM.git

To assemble, you'll need the Tasm 4.0 compiler and run tasm and tlink
against the source, in dosbox or other emulator.  

But first, you'll need to convert the utf-8 encoded modified.asm,
 back to a cp437 encoding, to be recognized properly inside of dosbox.

To convert it:
    iconv -f UTF-8 -t CP437  -o 437.asm modified.asm

Then copy the 437.asm to a dosbox, and assemble it.  It will assemble
without this step, but there will be subtle differences from the original
dosidle 2.51.  To compile it inside the dosbox use the tasm 4 assembler
(tasm.exe) and then link it with (tlink.exe)



Use
---

Run the assembled dosidle exe in the autoexec.bat of Dosbox-x.  And also
make sure to disable Dosbox-x's "Dosidle api" in its config, since we don't
want to use its built in idle detection.
